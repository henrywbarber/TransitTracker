# Transit Tracker
Welcome to the comprehensive Chicago Transit Tracking App. This IOS app prioritizes user experience, leveraging customizability for favorite busses and trains.

# Workflow:
## Designing Draft
Status: Started  
Description: Very rough draft with only pages so far.  
Links:  
- Figma: https://www.figma.com/design/onlH1b1vwHpA5h8Vfznyky/Transit-Tracker?m=auto&t=dvKBLU2jwQcwI4bE-1

## Begin React Native Prototype
Status: Started  
Description: This repository serves as a React Native template for further implementation.  
Notes:  
- Ideas to implement:
    - Home Page:
        - List of favorited stops
    - Search Page:
        - Search box for queries
        - Perhaps seperate into Bus Page and Train Page
    - Settings Page:
        - Dark/Light mode
        - Notifications

## Integrate Live API Data
Status: Started  
Description: API keys for both trains and busses (seperate APIs) have been acquired. Definely lots of work to be done understanding their data and putting it to use.
