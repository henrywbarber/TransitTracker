# Transit Tracker

**Transit Tracker** is a React Native app designed to provide real-time tracking and prediction data for Chicago's buses and trains. The app emphasizes user customization through favorites management and offers a clean, user-friendly interface for exploring transit routes and stops.

---

## Project Overview

This project is a part-time, ongoing side project aimed at leveraging official CTA APIs to build a practical transit tracking app. It focuses on delivering live data for Chicago buses and trains, allowing users to search stops, view arrival predictions, and manage favorites for quick access.

---

## Current Features

- **Live Bus Tracking**  
  Fetches routes, stops, and real-time arrival predictions from the official CTA Bus Tracker API.

- **Favorites Management**  
  Users can favorite specific bus stops for quicker access. Favorites are persisted locally using AsyncStorage.

- **Expandable Route & Stop Views**  
  Routes and stops can be expanded/collapsed to reveal detailed arrival predictions per direction.

- **Search Functionality**  
  Search stops by name across all routes to quickly find relevant information.

- **Pull-to-Refresh**  
  Refresh predictions for all currently expanded stops with a convenient refresh button.

- **Settings Screen (Basic)**  
  Toggle notifications on/off (placeholder for future notification implementation).
